        * Please check that the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/) does not explain the behavior you are seeing.
        * Please search in both [open](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to check that your bug has not already been filed.

        To fix any bug we must first reproduce it. To make this possible, please attach a small, runnable project or post a small, runnable code listing that reproduces what you are seeing.

        It is often impossible for us to reproduce a bug when working with only code snippets since we have to guess at the missing code.
